# Overview

Once opened, this app has a welcome screen that explains the game. As the sole inheritor of your uncle's fortune, you must find the key hidden deep within the haunted house. Choose where to explore.

I wanted to create a game that my daughters could play. Building an Android app is a good way to learn the technology and develop something they can use. This is one of the first Kotlin apps I've developed so I wanted build something beyond hello world but still within reach.

# Development Environment

* Android Studio 2022.2.1 Patch 1
* JDK 17
* Kotlin 1.8.20

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlin Develoment](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/android-overview.html)
* [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course)

# Future Work

* Add save and load game feature using a room database or a preference file
* Implement inventory system and key
* Look in to using fragments instead of activities to change certain parts of the screen
* Add sound
* Localize content (replace activity strings)
